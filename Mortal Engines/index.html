                <p>Mortal Engines is a story about
                    <br> a distopian world where all cities
                    <br> have either become traction cities
                    <br> (cities on wheels that eat other cities),
                    <br> or stay static and form the anti-
                    <br>traction league (a team of people who
                    <br> work together to bring down the 
                    <br>traction cities).</p>

            <p>In the Europe of the future, the great cities have uprooted themselves from the Earth and donned wheels; 
                roving the Hunting Ground that was once Europe, cities literally devour one another as part of a new social 
                construct called Municipal Darwinism. The mighty city of London, in danger of running out of "prey," looks toward 
                the east, where an enormous wall protects the static cities of the Anti-Traction League—the "heretics" who have chosen 
                the barbaric practice of living on the bare earth. But London's mad Lord Mayor develops a plan to get through the wall: 
                he resurrects a vicious and ancient technology, a post–20th-century update of the nuclear bomb, all the more horrible 
                with time and refinement, and mounts it in the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral. Against this wildly original backdrop plays 
                the story of Tom Natsworthy, a young Apprentice Historian who helps mine the museum vaults of the juggernaut London. 
                Tom becomes embroiled with his idol, the elder Historian Valentine, and also with the scarred girl Hester who owes 
                Valentine a debt of vengeance. Reeve's prose is sweeping and cinematic, his ideas bold and effortless; he deftly weaves 
                in social commentary on the perils of both war and consumerism, and presents the calamities that can result from poverty 
                and extreme wealth occupying the same quarters.
